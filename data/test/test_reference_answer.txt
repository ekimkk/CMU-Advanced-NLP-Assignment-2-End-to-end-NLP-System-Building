The Mathematics Department offered an "applied math/CS" bachelor's degree before an undergraduate program in computer science was created.
The two new departments formed at SCS in the 1990s were the Human-Computer Interaction Institute (1993) and the Institute for Software Research (1999).
The three new departments/centers formed at SCS in the 2000s were the Machine Learning Department (2006), the Ray and Stephanie Lane Center for Computational Biology (2009), and the Language Technologies Institute (originally the Center for Machine Translation).
In 2013, SCS had 284 faculty members and a total student enrollment of nearly 1,700.
As of 2013, the Robotics Institute had more than 100 ongoing research projects.
The Computer Science Department at Carnegie Tech was first established in 1965.

The Fringe team is celebrating its 50th anniversary of Buggy.
Fairings are a type of housing around the wheels that help reduce drag, make the vehicle quieter, and enhance its appearance.
The name of the Fringe team's workshop is the "Froom," located in the basement of the East Campus Garage.
The Fringe team has a tradition of naming their buggies with the letter "B," such as Boson, Blueshift, Bissa, and Bumper.
The Buggy Showcase is held on Thursday from noon to 2 p.m. in Weigand Gymnasium in the Cohon University Center.
The safety requirements for drivers during Buggy races include wearing a mouth guard, goggles, a harness with three points of contact to the buggy, gloves, and a helmet.
Some challenges faced by drivers during the races include potholes on the course, which can be dangerous for the low-riding buggies, and the condition of the course varying from year to year.
The team's philosophy is to teach everyone how to do everything, including driving and mechanics.
Depending on the course conditions, most heats may run just two lanes instead of three during the races.
The Mascot Identity Task Force was led by Susan Bassett and Jennifer Church.

Jamie Callan, Ph.D. Program Director, Professor.
Proficiency requirements include Writing, Presentation, Programming, and Teaching.
Propose, write, and defend a Ph.D. dissertation (thesis).
All LTI Ph.D. students must complete an oral presentation at the LTI each year.
Advisors are selected during the first month of the program...each student will be asked to indicate a first, second and third choice for advisor.
Students funded by research projects receive travel funding according to policies set by the individual projects.
A student in good standing may be granted a LOA of at most 1 year, upon written request to the Ph.D. Program Director and with consent of the student's advisor.
The target duration of the LTI Ph.D. is five years, although six years is also common.
