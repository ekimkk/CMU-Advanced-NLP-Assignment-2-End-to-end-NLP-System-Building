pretraining data design is critically under-documented and often guided by empirically unsupported intuitions. To address this, we pretrain 28 1.5B parameter decoder-only models, training on data curated (1) at different times, (2) with varying toxicity and quality filters, and (3) with different domain compositions. second, we explore the effect of quality and toxicity filters, showing a trade-off between performance on standard benchmarks and riskoftoxicgenerations.

generative diffusion models produce high-resolution images [18] and are easier to scale [56] and control [51]. The appeal of generative diffusion models is rooted in their ability to synthesize novel images that are os tensibly unlike anything in the training set.
