Pursuing a PhD could allow you to become highly specialized in your field and develop cutting-edge research skills, which could be very valuable in industry. On the other hand, gaining hands-on experience through internships or entry-level positions can also be incredibly beneficial, especially if you’re looking to start your career in a particular area. Ultimately, the decision is up to you - consider all of your options carefully before making a choice. 8

Short- Term Accommodation   LTI Ph.D.  Graduate Student Handbook  Page 31   may be extended by two (2) weeks, for a tot al of eight (8) weeks, where a longer absence  is medically necessary. Prior to the absence students must work with relevant university  faculty and staff to adjust their course work, research, teaching and other academic  responsibilities during the period of absence. This may include extensions of time to  complete assignments, incomplete grades, and/or dropping courses, shifting research  responsibilities and adjusting TA assignments. Students who take a Short -Term  Accommodation will remain enrolled.   • Formal Leave of Absence
