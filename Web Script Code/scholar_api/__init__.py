This module provides a function to generate a mapping of faculty names to their publications in a specific year. It uses google scholar to search for the author and their publications in a specific year. The result is saved to a file.

Example result:
{
    "Yonatan Bisk": [{
        "title": "WebArena: A Realistic Web Environment for Building Autonomous Agents",
        "pub_year": "2023",
        "citation": "The Twelfth International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2023"
