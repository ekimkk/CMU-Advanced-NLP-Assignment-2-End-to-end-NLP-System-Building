The Buggy Races
99
The race course distance is 0.84 miles around Schenley Park's Flagstaff Hill.
Six people are required
The Fringe team is celebrating its 50th anniversary of Buggy.
Some key features that the Fringe team focuses on for their buggies are fairings, which help reduce drag, make the vehicle quieter, and look cool.
"The name of Fringe's workshop is the ""Froom,"" located in the basement of the East Campus Garage."
"The Fringe team has a tradition of naming their buggies with the letter ""B,"" such as Boson, Blueshift, Bissa, and Bumper."
The Buggy Showcase is held on Thursday from noon to 2 p.m. in Weigand Gymnasium in the Cohon University Center.
The safety requirements for drivers during Buggy races include wearing a mouth guard, goggles, a harness with three points of contact to the buggy, gloves, and a helmet.
Some challenges faced by drivers during the races include potholes on the course, which can be dangerous for the low-riding buggies, and the condition of the course varying from year to year.
The team's philosophy is to teach everyone how to do everything, including driving and mechanics.
Depending on the course conditions, most heats may run just two lanes instead of three during the races.
The different parts of a buggy include a body, pushbar, wheels, safety harness, driving and braking mechanisms, and sometimes fairings.
Fairings are a type of housing around the wheels that help reduce drag, make the vehicle quieter, and enhance its appearance.
A year of planning goes into the races, which last just over two minutes.
Teams often keep secret the way they build the braking and steering mechanisms, as well as the types of wheels used on their buggies.
"The term ""Froom"" refers to the Fringe team's workshop in the basement of the East Campus Garage."
Other teams, such as Apex, often use names that connotate fire, while the SDC (Student Dormitory Committee) team uses names like Vice, Bane, Avarice, and Malice.
The condition of the race course varies from year to year due to potholes, which can make or break a fast run.
a team member who provides a signal for buggy drivers to know when to start the right-hand turn from Schenley Drive onto Frew Street.
Typical buggy drivers are often less than 5 feet, 3 inches in height and are mostly women, though not exclusively.
Teams practice for the races on nights and weekends throughout the fall and spring semesters, as weather permits.
to propel the buggy forward.
The design of buggies has evolved from two-man teams that once changed places halfway through a race and rode in rain barrels with bicycle wheels or three-wheeled ash cans, to the slick, torpedo-like vessels with nerves-of-steel drivers of today.
a person who propels a buggy via the pushbar along one of the five hills of the buggy course.
"The term ""transition"" refers to the procedure whereby one pusher finishes pushing a buggy and the next pusher in sequence starts to push that same buggy."
Some challenges faced by mechanics while building and maintaining buggies include keeping their processes secret, especially regarding the braking and steering mechanisms, and the types of wheels used.
